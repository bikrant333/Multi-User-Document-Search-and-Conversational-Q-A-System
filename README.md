# **Multi-User-Document-Search-and-Conversational-Q-A-System**
This system is a web-based multi-user document search application that allows users to securely search through their restricted-access documents and interact with an AI-powered conversational Q&A system. The system utilizes hybrid Search (semantic search + Keyword Search) powered by sentence transformers and integrates query summarization to provide more insightful responses.

## **Features**

* Secure Multi-User Authentication: Users can access only the documents assigned to them.

* Document Upload & Storage: Pre-loaded documents stored in a dedicated folder.

* Hybrid Search Approach: Combines keyword matching and semantic search for better accuracy.

* AI-Powered Conversational Q&A: Maintains context-aware responses using previous conversation history.

* Document Summarization: Extracts relevant excerpts and summarizes them for a concise answer.

* Follow-up Query Support: Users can refine their searches and receive context-aware responses.

## **Technologies Used**

+ Frontend: Streamlit

+ Backend: Python

###  NLP Models:

- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (Sentence Transformer for semantic search)

- facebook/bart-large-cnn (Summarization model)


### Libraries:

* streamlit (UI framework)

* sentence-transformers (Semantic similarity search)

* torch (Deep learning framework)

* transformers (Hugging Face models)

* PyPDF2 (PDF text extraction)

* pandas (Data handling)

## **Folder Structure**

üìÇ project_root/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ uploaded_docs/      # Folder containing uploaded PDF documents
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # Main Streamlit application
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # List of dependencies
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Documentation
 

## **Setup Instructions**

1Ô∏è. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Upload Documents
Place the PDF documents inside the uploaded_docs/ folder before running the app.

3. Run the Application
streamlit run app.py

## **User Authentication**

Users must enter their email to access their assigned documents. The USER_ACCESS dictionary in the code manages document access:

## **How It Works**

1Ô∏è. User Login: Users enter their email to authenticate.
2Ô∏è. Document Access: The system loads the documents assigned to the user.
3Ô∏è. Search & Retrieval: Uses semantic search and keyword matching to retrieve the most relevant excerpts.
4Ô∏è. Summarization & Contextual Responses: Uses an AI-powered summarization model to generate concise answers.Maintains conversation history for improved follow-up queries.

## **Future Enhancements**

‚úÖ User Upload Feature (Allow users to upload their own PDFs dynamically)

‚úÖ Advanced Query Expansion (Use LLMs for enhanced understanding of user queries)

‚úÖ Database Integration (Store user authentication and documents in a database)
